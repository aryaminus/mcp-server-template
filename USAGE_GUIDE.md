# Memory Palace MCP: User Guide

Welcome to the **Memory Palace MCP**! This guide will help you understand how to use your new gamified memory system through simple text messages.

## üè∞ What is a Memory Palace?

- **Spatial organization** - Place memories at 3D coordinates
- **Visual anchors** - Attach vivid visual imagery to memories
- **Gamification** - Earn XP, level up, and unlock achievements
- **Learning paths** - Follow guided tutorials to master the technique
- **Personalized guidance** - Choose a personality guide that matches your style
