# Memory Palace MCP: User Guide

Welcome to the **Memory Palace MCP**! This guide will help you understand how to use your new gamified memory system through simple text messages.

## üè∞ What is a Memory Palace?

The Memory Palace technique (also called Method of Loci) is an ancient memory enhancement technique where you place information in specific locations within an imagined physical space. By mentally "walking" through this space, you can retrieve the information more easily.

- **Spatial organization** - Place memories at 3D coordinates
- **Visual anchors** - Attach vivid visual imagery to memories
- **Gamification** - Earn XP, level up, and unlock achievements
- **Learning paths** - Follow guided tutorials to master the technique
- **Personalized guidance** - Choose a personality guide that matches your style
